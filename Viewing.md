## Viewing The Notes
You need to install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) in order to view the notes properly (although markdown interpreter show the notes, media files and links between the notes are not presented in it).

### Steps to follow
* Clone this repository.
* Open Obsidian
* Go to `Open another vault` > `Open folder as vault`
* Select the sub-directory under the cloned directory (or the directory) you want to open.
* Click `Open`
